## Data and Methodology

To examine the effects the storm had on housing prices, we did informal difference in difference analyses. We decided to do analysis at both the neighborhood level and at the census tract level. For the neighborhood level analysis, the data we used for housing prices was gathered from NYC Department of Finance, which included all sales from all boroughs from 2005-2017. We compared units sold in the neighborhoods within the inundation zones from 2012-2017 and then compared them to units sold in adjacent neighborhoods outside the inundation zones. For our tract level analyses, we used Social Explorer to create interactive maps based on ACS data, comparing the percent change in median housing price for adjacent tracts that were inside and outside of the inundation zone. 
 
For both the neighborhood and tract level analyses, we will look at estimates in 2012 versus 2013 to first show what occurred in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and then we will compare 2012 versus 2017 to show whether or not housing prices have recovered and stabilized as the market has readjusted over time.
