In conclusion, we successfully answered one of the two research questions posed in the introduction. Our investigation of Hurricane Sandy’s effects on the housing prices in southern Brooklyn and south-eastern Staten Island revealed that there was a temporary decrease in housing prices from 2012 to 2013. From 2014 to 2017 though, prices for properties in the inundation zones continued to rise, probably a result of intensified recovery efforts, and they are now ultimately comparable to the rest of New York City’s housing market. Our analysis of socioeconomic changes as a result of the storm did not provide such a clear answer, however. It is difficult to gauge these changes without more detailed data. We attempted to find trends from ACS data, but found that our results varied and were rather random. The variations in the socioeconomic data is likely the outcome of omitted variables that we could not fully take into account, along with any other factors that would affect the socioeconomic makeup of a census tract over a five year span. In the end, the answers to our research questions would have benefited from actual econometric analyses and access more detailed datasets on Hurricane Sandy, which indicates a large potential for future research.
